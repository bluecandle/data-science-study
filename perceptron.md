# what is perceptron?
A perceptron is a binary classification algorithm modeled after the functioning of the human brain—it was intended to emulate the neuron. The perceptron, while it has a simple structure, has the ability to learn and solve very complex problems

# multilayer perceptron
A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a group of perceptrons, organized in multiple layers, that can accurately answer complex questions. Each perceptron in the first layer (on the left) sends signals to all the perceptrons in the second layer, and so on. An MLP contains an input layer, at least one hidden layer, and an output layer.

# The Perceptron Learning Process
1. Takes the inputs which are fed into the perceptrons in the input layer, multiplies them by their weights, and computes the sum.
2. Adds the number one, multiplied by a “bias weight”. This is a technical step that makes it possible to move the output function of each perceptron (the activation function) up, down, left and right on the number graph.
3. Feeds the sum through the activation function—in a simple perceptron system, the activation function is a step function.
4. The result of the step function is the output.
