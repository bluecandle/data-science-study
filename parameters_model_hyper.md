# model parameter
internal to learn your network and is used to make predictions in a production deep learning model. The objective of training is to learn the values of the model parameters.

# hyper parameter
external parameter set by the operator of the neural network. For example, the number of iterations of training, the number of hidden layers, or the activation function. Different values of hyperparameters can have a major impact on the performance of the network.
